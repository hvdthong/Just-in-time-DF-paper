The measures they use are basic counts reflecting program size and structure and metrics proposed by McCabe and Halstead. The effect of program size has a major influence on these metrics, and they present a suitable method of adjusting the metrics for size. The metrics included in this model (in addition to size) are: the ratio of block comments to total lines of code, the number of decisions per function, and the relative vocabulary of program variables and operators. These metrics have potential for future use in the quality control of software.},
