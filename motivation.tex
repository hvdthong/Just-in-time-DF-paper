One of the most powerful forms of deep learning neural networks is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)~\cite{lecun2015deep}. CNNs are widely used to solve image pattern recognition problems and have been achieved significant results~\cite{karpathy2014large, lawrence1997face, krizhevsky2012imagenet}. Like traditional deep learning networks, CNNs receive an input and perform a product operation followed by a nonlinear function. The last layer is the output layer containing objective functions~\cite{zhao2017loss} associated with the labels of the input.
